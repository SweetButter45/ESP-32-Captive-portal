# ESP-32-Captive-portal
This project is a Wi-Fi captive portal setup for an ESP32. It creates a fake access point (AP) that masquerades as a router to prompt users to input a Wi-Fi password. Upon receiving the correct password, the ESP32 connects to the real Wi-Fi router, stores the valid password in EEPROM.
